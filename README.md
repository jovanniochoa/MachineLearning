### Summary ###
After applying machine learning techniques I can confidently say that I learned a lot more about hot to manade data to work with. Althought I don't like Machine Learning as much as fixing the data; I can say that I have found a passion as a Data Analyst thanks to the techniques I learned. I plan to continue working in the backend, but I don't think I will continue with Machine Learning. There is not doubt that Machine Learning will go far though given the new up and coming projects such as ChatGPT and others. I plan on keeping up with the changing developments by knowing how to best handle larger datasets. Thanks to these projects, I also learned where to find such datasets.
